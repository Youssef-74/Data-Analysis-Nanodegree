# Chinook Database
## Introduction
In this project, I will query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, try assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. To assist you in the queries ahead, the schema for the Chinook Database is provided below. You can see the columns that link tables together via the arrows.
